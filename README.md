# DataPuller
A plugin for BeatSaber that is like [HttpStatus](https://github.com/opl-/beatsaber-http-status), but I made my own one with a few extra tweaks such as BSR code and player health.  

## Installation:
To install this mod all you have to do is download the [latest version](https://github.com/kOFReadie/BSDataPuller/releases/latest) and place BOTH of the folders inside the archive into your BeatSaber ROOT directory, replace any files it asks you to.
### Required mods, these can all be found on the [Mod Assistant](https://github.com/Assistant/ModAssistant) app:
In order for this mod to function properly you must have installed the following mods:
- [BSIPA ^4.1.3](https://github.com/bsmg/BeatSaber-IPA-Reloaded)
- [BS Utils ^1.6.0](https://github.com/Kylemc1413/Beat-Saber-Utils)
- [BeatSaverSharp ^1.6.0](https://github.com/lolPants/BeatSaverSharp)

## Overlay:
There are few overlays that I know of at the moment but here are some:
| Overlay | Creator |
