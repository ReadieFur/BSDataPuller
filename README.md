# DataPuller
Gathers data about the current map you are playing to then be sent out over a websocket for other software to use, e.g. A web overlay like [BSDP-Overlay](https://github.com/kOFReadie/BSDP-Overlay). This mod works with multi PC setups!

## Dev docs (WIP):
I've not got much here yet but to make a start I will provide some sample data that is sent out over the websocket, I may have forgotten some of the details here but this should be enough to get going for now.  
The data is sent out as a JSON over an unsecure websocket at `ws://0.0.0.0:2946/BSDataPuller/<DATACLASS>`.  
I am working on getting it to be sent out over a secure websocket but unfortunatly I dont think it would be possible.  
If you want to access this data with another mod, add DataPuller as a refrence and subscribe to the data classes `Update` events, they will pass the data as a JSON however you can read the values straight from the class if you do `<class>.<data>`.
There are currently two data classes, they are:  
**MapData**:  
This is sent out every time a level is started, failed or paused.
